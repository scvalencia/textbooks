# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
### By Hal Abelson, and Jerry Sussman

Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) is a textbook aiming to teach the principles of computer programming, such as abstraction in programming, metalinguistic abstraction, recursion, interpreters, and modular programming. It was first published in 1985 by MIT Press and written by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professors Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman. It was formerly used as the textbook of MIT introductory programming class. Before SICP, the introductory courses were almost always filled with learning the details of some programming language, while SICP focuses on finding general patterns from specific problems and building software tools that embody each pattern.

This folder contains supporting material, code from relevant sections of the book that helped me to learn, exercises from the book, and assignments. My study of the book was based on the online course offered by the MIT OCW, and the folders follow the structure of the video lectures.
