# Compiler Construction for Digital Computers

This repository, exposes explorations done while reading [David Gries](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/gries/) book ["Compiler Construction for Digital Computers"](http://www.amazon.com/Compiler-Construction-Digital-Computers-David/dp/047132776X/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8). 
This was the first book written specifically on the practical aspects of compiler design and implementation, and it has great reviews for being practical without providing an empty tutorial, but a good extrapolation of theory (languages and machines) to computer implementations. It includes many topics such as grammars, formal languages, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation and macro processing.
