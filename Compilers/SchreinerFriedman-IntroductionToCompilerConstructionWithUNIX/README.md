# Introduction to Compiler Construction with UNIX

This repository, exposes explorations done while reading [Schreiner's](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ats/) and [Friedman's](http://friedman.cs.illinois.edu/) "Introduction to Compiler Construction with UNIX". That is, a practical book for studying UNIX tools for compile generation (mainly front-end). The book includes the construction of SampleC, a simple subset of the C programming language.
